    <h4>About</h4>
<p>Intro To Unity course is
  designed for students with little to no experience working with game engines
  as entry point into the field of game development. Students will learn the
  basics of the Unity3D engine, and to creatively and effectively build their
  own simple games.</p><p> This course will cover topics such as navigating and using
  the engine, basic game programming in C#, user interface development and
  introductory game design principles. Students will be assessed based on the
  functionality of their games and will receive further feedback on their
  implementation, execution and creativity.</p>

  <h2>In-Class Topics & Review Links</h2>
<section>
  <p>Each link is to a review of the specific topic on the
    guidebook website.</p>
  <h3 id="before">Before Class:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you have some hard drive space available. It's not realistic to install Unity and get a project working with <10gb of free space.</li>
    <li>Install Unity. <a href="https://guidebook.hdyar.com/unity-starting/setup/installing-unity/">See this guide on installing Unity.</a></li>
    <li>Install a C# IDE. I recommend Jetbrains Rider. See above link.</li>
    <li>You will want a 3-button mouse (mouse with middle-click and a scroll wheel). We will have a few to borrow during class, but it's worth picking one up.</li>
    <li>Don't forget your laptop charger.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Assignments</h2>
<section>
  <h3 id="proj1">1. Become an Expert & Design a Level</h3>
  <p>2 Part assignment after week 1, before week 2. Will be reviewed in class, there is nothing to submit.</p>
    <p>
    1. Make a level for your roll-a-ball game. Open the project, practice moving around the scene view, practice making cubes, making groups with parent/child relationships, and stretching/moving things around.</p>
    <p>
    2. Research and become an expert on one &quot;thing&quot;. Implement it into your project if possible. Start in the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html">manual</a>, and pick something that seems interesting to you.</p>

  <p><i>Here is a link to a variation of this assignment I give in another class I teach. The bottom of the webpage has a list of possible things to research: </i><a href="https://imm103.hdyar.com/assignments/playground-revision/" target="_blank"><i>https://imm103.hdyar.com/assignments/unity-playground/</i></a></p>
  <p>This assignment should take about an hour to complete.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 id="proj2">2. Implement a Mechanic</h3>
  <p>Your assignment for before-week-3 is &quot;implement a mechanic&quot;, which can be thought of &quot;try to start your game&quot;. Fresh unity project, probably, and try to make one little piece of your game work. For many of your ideas, this is likely to be player movement.</p>

  <p>In this process, you should focus on the one part of your
    game idea that feels either the most immediate (blocking other things from
    getting done) or unknown (involving research that will take an unknown amount
    of time). For a shooting game, perhaps that's figuring out the instantiation,
    and dealing with the movement/camera stuff after.
  </p>

  <p>Github code repositories may be useful to reference:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hunterdyar/UnitySimpleCharacterControllers">Simple 2D Character Controllers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hunterdyar/Unity-OneButtonMechanics">One Button Game Mechanics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hunterdyar/TopDownExampleGame">Top Down Example</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hunterdyar/Arcade-Shuffle-Unity">Arcade Shuffle</a></li>

</ul>
  <p><i>These are both basically just piles of example scripts of various mechanics that are all commented.</i></p>
  <p>Remember, it's okay to fail at this assignment. Coming to class with the knowledge of what questions to ask will be very helpful for week 3, where we have time set aside to answer these very questions.</p>

<section>
  <h3 id="finalproj"> Final Project: Make a Game</h3>
  <p>Your final project is to make a game, and make a working build of that game for windows or WebGL
    and hosted online somewhere. The project must be uploaded
    to the <a href="https://box.cmu.edu" target="_blank">box.cmu.edu</a> folder you
    have been given access to, and is due before midnight on the due date (TBD).</p>

  <p>The game must be playable in the form of a finished build (see below), and you must include a readme file (see below). </p>

  <p>Do not treat this as so big a project that it deserves as much time as given, I just assume you only work on it on weekends.
    It's a fun project! I hope you find it an enjoyable chance to learn new technical processes while being creative, in a low-stakes
    environment.</p>

  <p>The game should have 2 working mechanics, but will probably
    have more (mechanic = gameplay features/systems. &quot;movement&quot; is a
    mechanic, &quot;score&quot; is a mechanic, &quot;death&quot; is a mechanic).</p>

  <h5>Submission Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>A working build for Windows <strong>OR</strong> a link to a site hosting a WebGL build</li>
  <li>Review: <a href="https://guidebook.hdyar.com/unity-starting/unity-fundamentals/builds/">Making a Build</a></li>
  <li>It must be a game I can play on my Windows computer with a keyboard, mouse, and/or gamepad.</li>
  <li>Making a build for Mac is highly encouraged, but not required.</li>
  <li>If you have a Mac, please do make both. You want to test that your builds work, and if you can only test on Mac, you should be sure to submit that known-working build.</li>
  <li>Upload the entire contents of the build folder in a .zip to the box.cmu.edu shared class final projects folder. Make a folder with your name, and put everything there.</li>
  <li>Do not upload your unity project.</li>
  <li>For windows builds, this includes the _Data folder, Mono folder, exe,
    and UnityPlayer.dll files, and so on. For mac this is just the "something.app" file.</li>
  <li>For WebGL, you need to upload the build to BOX for archival, but that won't be playable. WebGL needs a webserver to work. You need to also upload to a server like simmer.io or itch.io or play.unity.com. A video explains how on the <a href="https://simmer.io/">simmer.io homepage</a>.</li>
</ul>
  <h5>Readme Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>A text file. No word doc or pdf's.</li>
  <li>Name, Class/ Semester/Section</li>
  <li>Title of the game</li>
  <li>Description of the game</li>
  <li>Controls/How to play (please)</li>
  <li>Attributes for ALL used assets, regardless of license.</li>
  <li><em>This includes assets you made yourself, if it isn't obvious.</em> Attribution format must be enough to be reasonably findable assuming the link dies:
    asset name, publisher, creator, publication date, access date &amp; version,
    link.</li>
  <li>What was one surprising success you had during development?</li>
  <li>What was one unexpected frustration you had during development?</li>
  <li>Anything else I need to know, background context</li>
  <li>Anything else you want to say about the project?</li>
  <li>A knock-knock joke (to prove you read this)</li>
</ul>
